  this website is used as a place for me to keep my stuff in, in a nice clean and tidy way. that includes anything from my blogs to my plans and ideas.</p>

<h3>[18 aug 2020]</h3>


<p>lots of changes...<br><br> I started learning Rust and Emacs, in order to get prepared for my huge plan, that being adverie.<br> most if not all of my other projects will need to be put on hold for possibly forever, this includes komorebi, pak, etc.</p>

<p>some of them may return if I find them useful for adverie development</p>

<p>my website now uses a simplified version of fika that parses just raw HTML and turns it into website pages. configuration is done by editing the script itself.</p>

<p>apart from that, some styling changes have been done and now I am using my own colorscheme, <a href="https://codeberg.org/taminaru/tamina">tamina</a></p>
