<h2>Social media was a mistake</h2>

<p>The way we have left social media affect everyone's lives and even the modern day world is terrifying, I would even dare say gross.</p>

<p>This is our fault for the most part, we are the ones supporting what has happened.</p>

<h2>To summarize</h2>

<p>We have people being mentally affected by bad influences randomly spreading their ego everywhere.</p>

<p>We have companies leaking everywhere like some sort of parasite, infesting everyone with their control and ecosystem. Turning people into nothing but money-throwing machines.
Said companies also have no respect towards their users, for all they care as long as they get money it's A-OK on their end.</p>

<h2>Sure, there _are_ exceptions</h2>

<p>Social media is not entirely corrupted... yet. We have things like the Fediverse, ActivityPub, etc. which have made social media actually enjoyable, but only for the people that are part of it.</p>

<h2>What can we do?</h2>

<p>Avoid the bad social media, leave it. It will only help it grow and cause even more harm.</p>

<p>Promote the good types of social media and/or not using social media at all.</p>

<p>Promote freedom, privacy and security, stop the harm by going straight to the roots of it.</p>
