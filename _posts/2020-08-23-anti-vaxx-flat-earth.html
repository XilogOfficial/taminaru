<p>I do not have anything about the types of people represented in the following blog post, nor do I wish to start a fight for no reason. Please, if you would kindly, take this with a grain of salt and do not come screaming at me before taking into account this is my own, <em>personal</em> opinion. Thank you and have a good day :)</p>

<h2>Anti-vaxx, Flat Earth, etc.</h2>

<h4>My view on it</h4>

<p>While I personally do not agree with those beliefs, they are still interesting to think about and study on. <br>
Obviously for example, with the Flat Earth idea, unless you bring a new possible mathematical proof the Earth is <u>not</u> round, you cannot deny science. But with Anti-vaxx some of the points are actually valid.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pharmacies <em>do very much</em> rip you off. Be it with marketing tactics or by just making the products very expensive.</li>
  <li>Natural medicine is actually great for your body, <del>provided you do not rely on just essential oils</del> a lot of the functional natural alternatives to medicine may be faster, more effective and less expensive.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>One particularly interesting detail about the people that support these ideologies is how it can apply to a very broad list of mentalities. And how a lot of the time these people show a very intense passion for protecting their point at a costs.</p>

<br>

<p>With that out of the way now, let's analyze how I think a person can start profoundly believing said topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scenario 1
  <p>The person is clueless and this is what made most sense to them.</p></li>
  <li>Scenario 2 (Something I can agree to as well at some extent.)
  <p>The person is aware of how many secrets are being kept to us (think: Anti-vaxx "Big Pharma" theory).</p></li>
  <li>Scenario 3
  <p>The person is a troll and just wants to annoy people.</p>
  <p>Let's face it, some do that, it is not new either.</p></li>
  <li>Scenario 4
  <p>The person does not care anymore, they are bored and just want to experience something new.</p></li>
  <li>Scenario 5 --- The Band Wagon Effect
  <p>They see the popularity of these theories and think they are true because of the number of followers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>There are obviously more possible scenarios but this is all that I can think of.</em></p>
