<h2>Comparing programming languages with pure math</h2>
<h4>how close are they really?</h4>
	
<p>Programming languages are usually described as being close to math and mathematical notation. However, to what extent does that apply?</p>

<p>For this comparison we will use the C programming language.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Instead of syntax, we will compare <em>how</em> the language works.</p>

<h4>Numbers</h4>

<p>In math we have the following number groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural numbers (N)</li>
<li>Integers (Z)</li>
<li>Rational numbers (Q)</li>
<li>Real numbers (R)</li>
</ul>
<p>*excluding whole numbers, since they are the same as natural numbers</p>

<p>In programming languages we usually have the following number groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integers</li>
<li>Floats</li>
</ul>

<p>Integers correspond exactly with math.<br />
Floats comprise of all rational and irrational numbers, plus integers.</p>
<p>Let's see an example in C:</p>

<pre><code>/* Equivalents to integers */
int a   = 4; /* usually 4 bytes */
short b = 2; /* usually 2 bytes */
long  c     = 4; /* usually 4 bytes */
long long d = 8; /* usually 8 bytes */

/* Floats (and doubles) */
float x = 3.2f /* NOTE: the 'f' denotates a floating point literal */
double y = 0.0;
</code></pre>

<p>C is, in general, not very off. The major differences are the need of having multiple data types connected with the computer's hardware.</p>


<h4>Functions</h4>

<p>In mathematical notation, one may describe a function like so:</p>

<pre><code>f(x) = x + 1
</code></pre>

<p>This function takes a variable, x, and adds 1 to it.<br />
Let's compare:</p>

<pre><code>int f(x) {
  putchar((x + 1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>C may not be close to mathematical notation, but the concept is still very similar. We are making a function, which takes the variable <code>x</code> and adds 1 to it.</p>


<h4>Sets</h4>
	
<p>The equivalent of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics)">sets</a> in C are arrays.</p>

<pre><code>/* This array holds double numbers */
double a[] = { 100.0, 42.0, 1.0, 0.0 };

/* This array holds 3 integers */
int b[3] = { 1, 2, 3 };
</code></pre>


<h4>Sequences</h4>
<p>In mathematical notation, sequences are usually written in this form:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) — finite sequence
(0, 1, 2, ...)  — infinite sequence
</code></pre>
<p>What differentiates sequences from arrays is that sequences <strong>must</strong> be in order.</p>
<p>C does not have sequences (not to be confused with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C">escape sequences</a>; however, we can get really close by using arrays.</p>
<pre><code>int i;

/* Sequence from 0 to 100 (including 0 and 100) */
for (i = 0; i &lt;= 100; ++i) {
    printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i); /* Prints the sequence */
}
</code></pre>
