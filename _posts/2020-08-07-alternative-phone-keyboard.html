<h2>Using alternative phone keyboard layouts</h2>

<p>Recently I have diven into the world of alternative keyboard layouts, starting with Dvorak --- which was an... interesting experience --- and then trying Colemak --- which was nice but felt <u>off</u> --- then finally resolving to Workman.</p>

<p>Prior to Workman, the other two layouts I have firstly tried on my laptop. But this time I wanted to try something new so I got the Workman layout working on my phone with the thanks of the FOSS app, <a href="https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io/">AnySoftKeyboard</a>.</p>

<p>At first, I expected the change to not be very noticeable, but I was mistaken. Not only did my initial typing speed drastically fall down --- which then, as expected, became really fast --- but the way I was holding my phone also changed.<br><br>
To give some reference, I have a 5.99'' display with a reasonably thin width phone. After switching to Workman, I have started holding my phone closer to its middle, which was because the amount of travel my fingers had to do was minimized.</p>

<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>

<p>If you have the <u>time</u> and <u>patience</u> needed, absolutely!</p>

<p>It is both a good way to give your brain new stimuli and pottentially have better ergonomics while typing --- this applying to both desktop and phone.</p>
